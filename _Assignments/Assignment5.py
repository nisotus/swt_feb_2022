# SIMPLE CALCULATOR
# Write a Python program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division based on two inputs from the user
# So the program should perform all above arithmetic operations on any set two numbers you pass to it.


#Solution


# calculator1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
# calculator2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# sum = calculator1 + calculator2

# subtraction = calculator1 - calculator2

# multiplication = calculator1 * calculator2
# division = calculator1 / calculator2

# print (sum)
# print(subtraction)
# print(multiplication)
# print(division)

number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: \n"))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: \n"))

calculator = number1 + number2
print("The addition is" , calculator)
