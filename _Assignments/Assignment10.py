# SIMPLE CALCULATOR USING TENARY OPERATOR
# Write a Python program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division based on two inputs from the user
# The program should ask the user which of the four arithmetic operations below the user wants to perform:
# addition
# subtraction
# multiplication
# division

# Based on the selection of the operator by teh user, the selected arithmetic operator is performed and the result should be printed to the terminal.

# num1 = int(input("Enter first number:   "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter second number:  "))
# opr = input("""What do you want to do?
#     -   for subtraction
#     +   for addition
#     /   for division
#     *   for multiplication
#     """)

# (print(f'Subtraction: {num1 - num2}') if opr == '-' else
# print(f'Addition: {num1 + num2}') if opr == '+' else
# print(f'Division: {num1 / num2}') if opr == '/' else
# print(f'Multiplication: {num1 * num2}'))


#student = True
#goodCredit = True
#highIncome = True

#print("Eligible") if ((not student) and (
 #   goodCredit or highIncome)) else print("Not eligible")
