# Write a Python program using classes to create attributes and behaviours for different Animals
# Create a base class called "Animal"
# Make sure to show in your code that your "Animal" class inherits attributes and behaviour from the "Object" class
# The "Animal" class should have the attributes: Eyes, Head, Ears, Nose, Legs,

# The "Animal" class should have behaviours: Walk, Run, Eat, Jump, Swim, Cry, Sleep, Slither, Crawl, Bark, Roar, Hiss

# Create additinal classes of animals including: Lion, Shark, Goat, Frog, Snake, Lizard, Dog

# Think about how ou can craete the subclasses by category
# For example, we know that fishes can swim and Dogs can bark, so craete the sub classes to capture all attributes ad behaviours above

# Make sure you don't leave any attribute or behaviour out of your implimentation.
