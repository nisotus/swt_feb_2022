# Write a Python program for a car wash system
# The car wash has 4 levels of washing (Normal, Basic, Gold, Platinum)
# The cost is calculated based on the level and the car size (Small, Medium, Large)

# I want you to think of an approach to to implement this solution by using prices (for the different levels) and numbers for the car size.
# You will need to multiply these values to get a washing cost
# You need to take all the values that is needed as input and display the final cost based on the input from the customer

# Name
# Level
# size
# payment amount
