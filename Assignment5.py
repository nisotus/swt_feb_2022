# SIMPLE CALCULATOR
# Write a Python program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division based on two inputs from the user
# So the program should perform all above arithmetic operations on any set two numbers you pass to it.

compute_num2 = int(input('enter a number '))

add_num = compute_num1 + compute_num2

div_num = compute_num1 / compute_num2
