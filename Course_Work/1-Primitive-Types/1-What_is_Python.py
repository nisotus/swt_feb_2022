# Why Python?
#  1-Less or few lines of code
#  2- Python is a multi-purpose programming language
# Reasons 3 - 6
# High Level Programming Language
# Cross-Platform
# Huge Community
# Large Ecosystem


# What are the built-in primitive types in Python?

 # What will be printed to the terminal?
# fruit = "Apple"

# print(fruit[1])

 # What will be printed to the terminal?
#  fruit = "Apple"
#  print(fruit[1:-1])

#hat is the result of this expression?
# m = 10 % 3
# print(m)
# print(bool("False"))

#  print(10 + 3)  # addition
#  print(10 - 3)  # subtraction
#  print(10 * 3)  # multiplication
#  print(10 / 3)  # division with remainder
#  print(10 // 3)  # division without remainder = Integer
#  print(10 % 3)  # division to get only the remainder
#  print(10 ** 3)  # exponent - 10 to the power of 3

#  # What will be printed to the terminal?
